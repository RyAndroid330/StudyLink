<lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus is my Saviour,
 I shall not be moved;
 In His love and favour,
 I shall not be moved;
 Just like a tree that's planted
 by the waters,
 I shall not be moved.

[C1]
   CHORUS:
   I shall not be,
   I shall not be moved,
   I shall not be,
   I shall not be moved;
   Just like a tree that's planted
   by the waters,
   I shall not be moved.

[V2]
 In my Christ abiding,
 I shall not be moved;
 In His love I'm hiding,
 I shall not be moved;
 Just like a tree that's planted
 by the waters,
 I shall not be moved.

[V3]
 If I trust Him ever,
 I shall not be moved:
 He will fail me never,
 I shall not be moved;
 Just like a tree that's planted
 by the waters,
 I shall not be moved.

[V4]
 On His word I'm feeding,
 I shall not be moved,
 He's the One that's leading,
 I shall not be moved,
 Just like a tree that's planted
 by the waters,
 I shall not be moved.

[V5]
 Glory hallelujah,
 I shall not be moved;
 Anchored in Jehovah,
 I shall not be moved;
 Just like a tree that's planted by
 the waters,
 I shall not be moved.

[V6]
 In His love abiding,
 I shall not be moved;
 And in Him confiding,
 I shall not be moved:
 Just like a tree that's planted
 by the waters,
 I shall not be moved.

[V7]
 Though all hell assail me,
 I shall not be moved;
 Jesus will not fail me,
 I shall not be moved;
 Just like a tree that's planted
 by the waters,
 I shall not be moved.

[V8]
 Though the tempest rages,
 I shall not be moved,
 On the Rock of Ages,
 I shall not be moved;
 Just like a tree that's planted
 by the waters,
 I shall not be moved.</lyrics>
