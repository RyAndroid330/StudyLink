.D                            A                    Bm
 Through You I can do anything, I can do all things
.                                G                         D
 Cause its you who gives me strength, nothing is impossible
.D                               A                       Bm
 Through you, blind eyes are open, Strongholds are broken
.                 G
 I am living by faith, nothing is impossible

[V2]
.D             Em             G
 I'm not gonna live by what I see,
.Bm            A              G
 I'm not gonna live by what I feel

[P1]
.  Bm           A                G
   Deep down I, Know that You're here with me
.  Bm           A          Em G
   I know that, You can do anything

[B1]
.  G              D
   I believe, I believe,
.  Em            G
   I believe, I believe in You x2</lyrics>
