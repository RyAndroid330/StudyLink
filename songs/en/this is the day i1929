 This is the day, the Lord has made
.E/G#                            A
 Let us be glad - Give Him praise
.E/B           E7/B        A
 Rejoicing now that we are saved
 That's why

 Everybody in the church is dancing

[V2]
 Your mercy makes us celebrate
 And revel in Your lavish grace
 This joy we've got to demonstrate
 That's why
 Everybody in the church is dancing
