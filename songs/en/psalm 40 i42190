.A2           A2/C#       D2
 Holy Spirit, I need Your touch
.          E Esus G#
 More than ever before.
.A2        A2/C#       D2
 Oh Jesus, I need Your love,
.        E  Esus   G#
 And I'm desperate for more.

[P1]
.  F#m         A2            D2         E
   When I feel Your presence all around me,
.  F#m         A2           D2            E
   When I feel Your arms as they surround me,

[C1]
.  A2               A2/C#
   I cannot hide my love!

   I cannot hide my love!
.     E
   My feet will have to dance;
.  A2               A2/C#
   I cannot hide my love!
.                   D2
   I cannot hide my love!

   My heart will have to sing.
