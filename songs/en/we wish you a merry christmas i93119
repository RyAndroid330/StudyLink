 We wish you a merry Christmas
 We wish you a merry Christmas
 We wish you a merry Christmas
 and a happy new year

[C1]
   Good tidings we bring
   to you and your kin
   We wish you a merry Christmas
   and a happy new year

[V2]
 Oh, bring us some figgy pudding
 Oh, bring us some figgy pudding
 Oh, bring us some figgy pudding
 And bring it right here

[C2]
   Good tidings we bring
   to you and your kin
   We wish you a merry Christmas
   and a happy new year

[V3]
 We won't go until we get some
 We won't go until we get some
 We won't go until we get some
 So bring it right here

[C3]
   Good tidings we bring
   to you and your kin
   We wish you a merry Christmas
   and a happy new year

[V4]
 We all like our figgy pudding
 We all like our figgy pudding
 We all like our figgy pudding
 With all its good cheers

[C4]
   Good tidings we bring
   to you and your kin
   We wish you a merry Christmas
   and a happy new year

[V5]
 We wish you a merry Christmas
 We wish you a merry Christmas
 We wish you a merry Christmas
 and a happy new year</lyrics>
