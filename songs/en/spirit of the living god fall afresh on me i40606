<lyrics>[V1]
 Spirit of the living God
 Fall fresh on me
 Spirit of the living God
 Fall fresh on me
 Melt me, mold me, fill me, use me
 Spirit of the living God
 Fall fresh on me

[V2]
 Spirit of the living God
 Fall fresh on us
 Spirit of the living God
 Fall fresh on us
 Melt us, mold us, fill us, use us
 Spirit of the living God
 Fall fresh on us

[V3]
 Holy Presence, love divine
 Cast away my fear
 Holy Presence, love divine
 Cast away my fear
 Shield me, free me, call me, lead me
 Holy presence, love divine, cast out my fear</lyrics>
