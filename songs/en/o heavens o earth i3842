 O heavens, O earth
 Our God is worthy of our praise
 We were all sinful at heart
 We owe all to wondrous grace
 Through the Savior
 Who came down from on high
 We received grace

[V2]
 O heavens, O earth
 We are all saved by his true grace
 We were all sinful at heart
 We were starved, craving love
 Through his love that
 Came to us from above
 We reached God

[V3]
 O heavens, O earth
 Our God's pow'r 's enough for anything
 We were all sinful at heart
 We were mired deep in sin
 Through his pardon
 That came from heav'n above
 Grace cleansed us

[V4]
 O heavens, O earth
 Our way leads to eternity</lyrics>
