 Oh I'm trav'ling on the Hallelujah line,
 On the good old gospel train.
 I am on the right track
 And never will go back
 To the station of sin again.
 I need no fare,
 I am riding on the pass.
 'Tis the Lamb for sinners slain.
 Oh I'm trav'ling on the Hallelujah line,
 On the good old gospel train.</lyrics>
