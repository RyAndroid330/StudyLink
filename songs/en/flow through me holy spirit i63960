 Flow through me, Holy Spirit,
 Flow through me.
 Flow through me, Holy Spirit,
 Flow through me.
 As I lift my hands to worship
 and to magnify Thy Name,
 Flow through me, Holy Spirit,
 Flow through me.
 Flow through me, Holy Spirit
 Flow through me.
 Like river in the desert,
 Flow through me .
 Springing fountains, Healing streams
 Living waters pure and clean
 Flow through me Holy Spirit
 Flow through me</lyrics>
