<lyrics>[V1]
 For God so loved the world
 that He gave his only Son
 that whosoever will
 believeth in Him
 shall never die
 but shall have eternal life
 and this is why we sing
 Hallelujah

[C1]
   Hallelujah (x4)Amen
   Hallelujah (x4)

[V2]
 Amazing Grace
 How sweet the sound
 that saved a wretch
 like me
 I once was lost
 but now am found
 I once was blind
 but now I see</lyrics>
