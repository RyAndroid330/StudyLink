<lyrics>[V1]
 I am redeemed,
 bought with a price.
 Jesus has changed my whole life.
 If anybody ask you just who I am,
 tell them I am redeemed.

[V2]
 Where there was hate,
 love now abounds.
 Where there was strife,
 peace now reigns.
 I'm walking with my Saviour,
 I'm a child of the King,
 all because I am redeemed.</lyrics>
