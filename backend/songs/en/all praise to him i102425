<lyrics>[V1]
 All praise to Him, the God of light
 Who formed the mountains by His might
 All praise to Him Who names the stars
 That sing His fame in skies afar
 All praise to Him Who reigns in love
 Who guides the galaxies above
 Yet bends to hear our every prayer
 With sovereign pow'r and tender care

[V2]
 All praise to Him whose love is seen
 In Christ the Son, the Servant King
 Who left behind His glorious throne
 To pay the ransom for His own
 All praise to Him Who humbly came
 To bear our sorrow, sin, and shame
 Who lived to die, Who died to rise
 The all-sufficient sacrifice

[V3]
 All praise to Him whose pow'r imparts
 The love of God within our hearts
 The Spirit of all truth and peace
 The fount of joy and holiness
 To Father, Son, and Spirit now
 Our souls we lift, our wills we bow
 To You, the triune God, we raise
 With loving hearts our song of praise</lyrics>
