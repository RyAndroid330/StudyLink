<lyrics>[V1]
 // Baruch Adonai, Elohey Yisrael Adonai,
 Blessed is the Lord //

[V2]
 Min ha-olam, V'ad ha-olam
 Praise His Name, forever and again,
 Min ha-olam, V'ad ha-olam,
 Blessed is the Lord, The God of Israel.

[V3]
 So let the nations sing and praise Him,
 And Israel will say, AMEN,
 Sing all you nations, Hallelujah,
 And Israel will say, Amen</lyrics>
