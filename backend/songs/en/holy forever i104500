.A                    D                       A/C#
 A thousand generations falling down in worship
.F#m            E                D
 To sing the song of ages to the Lamb
 And all who've gone before us and all who will believe
 Will sing the song of ages to the Lamb

[P1]
.    D                  F#m
   Your name is the highest
.    E
   Your name is the greatest
.  F#m                          D
   Your name stands above them all
.  D                     F#m
   All thrones and dominions
.  E
    All powers and positions
.  F#m                         B
   Your name stands above them all

[C1]
.           D      F#m E
   And the angels cry, Holy
.                 A     F#m
   All creation cries, Holy
.                 Bm     E
   You are lifted high, Holy
.           A
   Holy forever

[V2]
 If you've been forgiven and if you've been redeemed
 Sing the song forever to the Lamb
 If you walk in freedom and if you bear His name
 Sing the song forever to the Lamb
 We'll sing the song forever and amen

[C2]
   Hear your people sing, Holy
   To the King of Kings, Holy
   You will always be, Holy
   Holy forever

[B1]
   You will always be, Holy
   Holy forever</lyrics>
