.     D         G        D
 Give ear to my words O Lord
.   G     Em      A
 Consider my meditation
. G               D            Em
 Hearken unto the voice of my cry

.   G                Em          A
 My voice shalt Thou hear in the morning

.     G           D           G
 Will I direct my prayer unto Thee
.    Em    A
 And will look up</lyrics>
