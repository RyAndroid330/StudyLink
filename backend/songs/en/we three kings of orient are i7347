<lyrics>[V1]
 We three kings of Orient are
 Bearing gifts, we traverse afar
 Field and fountain, moor and mountain
 Following yonder star

[C1]
   Oh, star of wonder, star of might
   Star with royal beauty bright
   Westward leading, still proceeding
   Guide us to thy perfect light

[V2]
 Born a babe on Bethlehem's plain
 Gold we bring to crown him again
 King forever, ceasing never
 Over us all to reign

[V3]
 Frankincense to offer have I
 Incense owns a deity nigh
 Prayer and praising, all men raising
 Worship God on high

[V4]
 Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume
 Breathes a life of gathering gloom;
 Sorr'wing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
 Sealed in the stone cold tomb.

[V5]
 Glorious now behold Him arise;
 King and God and sacrifice;
 Alleluia, Alleluia,
 Sounds through the earth and skies.</lyrics>
