<lyrics>[V1]
 Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
 Let me hide myself in Thee;
 Let the water and the blood,
 From Thy wounded side which flowed,
 Be of sin the double cure;
 Save from wrath and make me pure.

[V2]
 Not the labor of my hands
 Can fulfill Thy law's demands;
 Could my zeal no respite know,
 Could my tears forever flow,
 All for sin could not atone;
 Thou must save, and Thou alone.

[V3]
 Nothing in my hand I bring,
 Simply to the cross I cling;
 Naked, come to Thee for dress;
 Helpless look to Thee for grace; Foul,
 I to the fountain fly; Wash me, Savior, or I die.

[V4]
 While I draw this fleeting breath,
 When mine eyes shall close in death,
 When I soar to worlds unknown,
 See Thee on Thy judgment throne,
 Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
 Let me hide myself in Thee.</lyrics>
