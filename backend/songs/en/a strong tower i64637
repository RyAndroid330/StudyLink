<lyrics>[V1]
 The Name of the Lord is
 a strong tower
 The righteous run into it
 and they are safe.
 (x2)

[C1]
   Blessed be the name of the Lord,
   Blessed be the name of the Lord,
   Blessed be the name of the Lord most High.
   Blessed be the name of the Lord,
   Blessed be the name of the Lord,
   Blessed be the name of the Lord most High.

[C2]
   Jesus is the name of the Lord,
   Jesus is the name of the Lord,
   Jesus is the name of the Lord most High.
   Jesus is the name of the Lord,
   Jesus is the name of the Lord,
   Jesus is the name of the Lord most High.</lyrics>
