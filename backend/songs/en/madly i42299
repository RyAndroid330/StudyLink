.          A/E                E
   And I'm madly in love with you. (4X)

[V1]
.            C#m   B
 Let what we do in here
.         A           E
 Fill the streets out there;
.       A         E
 Let us dance for you,
.       B         E
 Let us dance for you.

[B1]
.            A                E
   All of my life and nothing less,
.             B                E
   I offer to You, my Righteousness (2X)</lyrics>
