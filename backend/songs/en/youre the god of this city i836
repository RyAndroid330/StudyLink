 You're the Lord of this nation.
.    F
 You are.
.                    Am
 You're the light in this darkness.
.                       C
 You're the hope to the hopeless.

 You are.

 You're the Lord of creation,
 The Creator of all things.
 You're the King above all kings.
 You are.
 You're the strength in the weakness.
 You're the love to the broken.
 You're the joy in the sadness.
 You are.

   In this city.
.    F2
   Greater things have yet to come

   In this city.

[V3]

   There is no one like our God.
   There is no one like our God.
   There is no one like You God.
   There is no one like You God.</lyrics>
