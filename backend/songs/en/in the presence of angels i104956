 This is a realm of Your glory
 This is a realm of Your grace
 I can feel Your mighty power
 It is moving in this place

[V2]
 We're in the presence of angels
 With God's glory on their wings
 Like the voice of many waters
 I can hear the angels sing

[V3]
 Holy, holy, holy, holy
 Worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy
 Glory, glory, glory, glory

[V4]
 This is a realm of Your glory
 This is a realm of Your grace
 All my heart's desire is to see Your face</lyrics>
