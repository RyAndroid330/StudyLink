<lyrics>[C1]
   Precious Lord, take my hand
   Lead me on, let me stand
   I'm tired, I'm weak, I'm worn
   Through the storm, through the night
   Lead me on to the light
   Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

[V1]
 When my way grows drear precious Lord linger near
 When my life is almost gone
 Hear my cry, hear my call
 Hold my hand lest I fall
 Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

[V2]
 When the darkness appears and the night draws near
 And the day is past and gone
 At the river I stand
 Guide my feet, hold my hand
 Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

[V3]
 When my work is all done
 And my race here is are you-un
 Let me see-ee by the light
 Thou hast shown
 That fair city so bright
 Where the lantern is the li-ight
 Take my ha-and, precious Lor-ord
 Lead me on</lyrics>
