.     Bm     G      D
 The first noel the angels did say
 Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
 In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
 On a cold winter's night that was so deep

[V2]

 Noel, noel, noel, noel
.G     C/F#  D
 Noel, noel, noel, noel

[V3]
 They looked up and saw a star
 Shining in the east, beyond them far
 And to the earth it gave great light
 And so it continued both day and night
