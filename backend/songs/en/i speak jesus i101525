<lyrics>[V1]
 I just want to speak the name of Jesus
 Over every heart and every mind
 'Cause I know there is peace within your presence
 I speak Jesus

[V2]
 I just want to speak the name of Jesus
 'Til every dark addiction starts to break
 Declaring there is hope and there is freedom
 I speak Jesus

[C1]
   'Cause your name is power
   Your name is healing
   Your name is life
   Break every stronghold
   Shine through the shadows
   Burn like a fire

[V3]
 I just want to speak the name of Jesus
 Over fear and all anxiety
 To every soul held captive by depression
 I speak Jesus

[C2]
   Your name is power
   Your name is healing
   Your name is life
   Break every stronghold
   Shine through the shadows
   Burn like a fire

[B1]
   Shout Jesus from the mountains
   Jesus in the streets
   Jesus in the darkness over every enemy
   Jesus for my family
   I speak the holy name
   Jesus

[C3]
   Your name is power
   Your name is healing
   Your name is life
   Break every stronghold
   Shine through the shadows
   Burn like a fire

[B2]
   Shout Jesus from the mountains
   And Jesus in the streets
   Jesus in the darkness over every enemy
   Jesus for my family
   I speak the holy name
   Jesus

[C4]
   Your name is power
   Your name is healingYour name is life
   Break every stronghold
   Shine through the shadows
   Burn like a fire

[V4]
 I just want to speak the name of Jesus
 Over every heart and every mind
 'Cause I know there is peace within his presence
 I speak Jesus</lyrics>
