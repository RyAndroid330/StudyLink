.C            Dm
 What a fiend I've found,
.C               Dm
 Closer than a brother;
.C                  Dm
 I have felt Your touch,
.     C              Dm
 More intimate than lovers.

[C1]

   Je-sus, Je-sus, Je  - sus,
.    F    C/E G/D  C
   Friend for-ev - er.

[V2]
.C                  Dm
 What a hope I've found,
.       C               Dm
 More faithful than a mother;
.C                   Dm
 It would break my heart
.   C                Dm
 To ever lose each other.</lyrics>
